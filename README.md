Tour Services: Offers a range of tour services, including booking facilities and the ability to customize the number of days for each tour.
Dynamic Pricing: Implements a dynamic day-to-price calculator based on a predefined per-day price, allowing flexibility in pricing for different tour durations.
Booking Information: Displays booked places by any customer, providing a transparent overview of reservations. This information is accessible to both customers and administrators.
Customer-Facing Dashboard: Empowers customers to view their booked places and access relevant tour details through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Admin Panel: Equips administrators with the tools to monitor bookings, and oversee the overall functioning of the tour management system.
